# Portfolio
A small portfolio of some of the projects I found extra interesting during my studies. Some projects are individual and other together with other students.

# Word-Based Recurrent Neural Network Cooking Recipe Generator
Abstract:  
A project where I implemented and investigated how a word-based RNN (Recurrent
Neural Network) could be used to generate cooking recipes. The idea is since
it is a word-based RNN, and not character-based, the model should be able to
produce meaningful recipes with contextual sentences. A model was trained
using a dataset of approximately 90 000 recipes containing three sections.

# Self-flying Airplane using Proximal Policy Optimization
Abstract:  
This report covers the theory and implementation of training an AI-agent to navigate through an environment, reaching checkpoints without crashing along the way. The agent takes the shape of an old fighter jet and everything is visualized in a 3D environment using Unity. The agent is trained using reinforcement learning methods, more specifically using the algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization which allows for a more stable and consistent training. The results show that Proximal Policy Optimization can successfully train an agent to follow a set of checkpoints in a certain order and that more complex actions and environments are possible to achieve.
